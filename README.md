# Habit tracker

Track your habits in a descentralized way and commit to do them for a period of time while putting some collateral in the line.

### To run:

1) yarn install
2) yarn chain (leave running)
3) yarn deploy
4) yarn start

Create a habit and you can check it out on the habits tab. After that you can do your habit and check how it updated on the gallery (as an NFT)
